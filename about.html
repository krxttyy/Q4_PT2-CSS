        	<h2>The Meaning of Rithika</h2>
            <p>Derived from Sanskrit, <strong>Rithika</strong> is a modern girl's name commonly meaning <em>"small river," "stream,"</em> or <em>"passage."</em> It represents the concept of flow and is often associated with tradition, truth, and righteousness. Much like its origins in South India, the name symbolizes a personality that is graceful, knowledgeable, and determined.</p>
